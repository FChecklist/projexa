## API Hub (planned, 14 Nov 2026)
One portal where every product shows its AI-facing API on one page, built step by step. Today the Tambola AI links, the PROJEXA AI link, the DPDP AI link and the compliance-tracker API with MCP exist in separate forms; the Corporate Games AI gateway is built but not deployed. Nothing about the Hub is live yet. The plan and inventory are in the marketing-ledger repository under api-hub/.

## Rules that apply in every repository
- Payments for all products go only through the one payee and one gateway on the IT Services site. No product takes money any other way.
- Deploy only when the owner says so. Writing code or docs is never a reason to deploy.
- Never store keys, tokens, passwords, e-mail lists or phone numbers in a repository.
- Fairness wording is per product and must be true in code (for example: no one knows the next number).
- Check this map before building anything, so you do not rebuild what another repository already does.

Other older repositories (jyotish-*, veridian-brain, veridian-ai-os, veridian-bridge and similar) are outside this map unless their own README says otherwise. Ask BOSS.
